42.9987,-76.1299,,,Housing & Property Maintenance,"111 Lafayette Rd Syracuse, New York, 13205",Home & Building Maintenance,"The ceiling of the bathroom in the apartment unit of Nobhill Building 1 experienced its first leak on September 25, 2024. A maintenance worker came to inspect it on September 26, but only took a quick look and said he needed to check the unit above. He never returned after that. Subsequent leaks occurred on October 22, 2024, November 2, 2024, November 25, 2024, December 2, 2024, December 26, 2024, January 2, 2025, and January 3, 2025. Each time, the maintenance worker’s actions were the same as during the first incident.  

The two leaks in 2025 clearly involved sewage. The leak on January 2 had a strong fecal odor and contained visible solid fecal matter, with the water appearing brown. The leak on January 3 had a strong urine odor. On January 3, I reported all these issues to Assistant Community Manager Ryan Tinsley and requested that the apartment management clean up the sewage. However, he explicitly refused to clean it up, stating that he believed it was the tenant’s responsibility under New York State regulations, even though the sewage was caused by unresolved leaks.

Unable to endure the foul fecal odor in the bathroom, I began cleaning the sewage on the afternoon of January 3. After cleaning most of the affected areas, the final leak (on January 3) occurred while I was crouched cleaning the bathtub. The sewage splashed directly onto me. We called the emergency maintenance line, and maintenance personnel from another building came and shut off the upstairs toilet valve.  

It is clear that my husband and I were exposed to living in a sewage-contaminated apartment for at least four days (January 2 to January 5). During this time, the bathroom was unusable, and we were unable to shower."
