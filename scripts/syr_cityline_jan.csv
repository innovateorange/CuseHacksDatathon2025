43.0357,-76.0979,,,Feedback to the City,"416 Brookford Rd Syracuse, New York, 13224",Please use this space to provide feedback to the City,"This morning, our garbage was not picked up. The reason cited after talking to the Department of Public Works was that it was too heavy or exceeded the allowed weight. My wife watched the workers touching our trash can and leaving it there. We were attentive because this happened before. No one weighted the trash can or tried to use the new equipment at any time. I was told that this was a violation and that the garbage would not be picked up until next week. They set up a bulk garbage pick up for next week and will have to keep garbage for one week in my garage. This will also use one of two allowed bulk pickups for the year. I put the trash out myself and it was not very heavy and the lid was closed. How can one say the our garbage exceed the weight without weighing it? Also, after the worker checked our trash can or bin, they left the lid off which resulted on having lot of snow in it which will make it even heavier. I have lived in the city for 25 years and this type of situation never occurred until now.  A few months ago, the same thing happened and they picked up the garbage the following day. When the workers did pick up the garbage the next day they did it yelling obscenities for several minutes (my wife and daughter were home and witnessed that). I did not reported this because I thought it was rare event.  This now happens for the second time without telling or cursing but the same type of dismissive behavior.  This needs to be looking into and I expect someone to contact me.  When I called this morning and asked to speak to a supervisor, they asked for my contact information but I’m still waiting to hear from that person.  We pay an obscene amount of taxes for me to be wasting my time dealing with this issue.  I already spent almost 2 hours of my time at work dealing with this.

A maintenance worker came to inspect it on September 26, but only took a quick look and said he needed to check the unit above. He never returned after that. Subsequent leaks occurred on October 22, 2024, November 2, 2024, November 25, 2024, December 2, 2024, December 26, 2024, January 2, 2025, and January 3, 2025. Each time, the maintenance worker’s actions were the same as during the first incident.  

The two leaks in 2025 clearly involved sewage. The leak on January 2 had a strong fecal odor and contained visible solid fecal matter, with the water appearing brown. The leak on January 3 had a strong urine odor. On January 3, I reported all these issues to Assistant Community Manager Ryan Tinsley and requested that the apartment management clean up the sewage. However, he explicitly refused to clean it up, stating that he believed it was the tenant’s responsibility under New York State regulations, even though the sewage was caused by unresolved leaks.

Unable to endure the foul fecal odor in the bathroom, I began cleaning the sewage on the afternoon of January 3. After cleaning most of the affected areas, the final leak (on January 3) occurred while I was crouched cleaning the bathtub. The sewage splashed directly onto me. We called the emergency maintenance line, and maintenance personnel from another building came and shut off the upstairs toilet valve.  

It is clear that my husband and I were exposed to living in a sewage-contaminated apartment for at least four days (January 2 to January 5). During this time, the bathroom was unusable, and we were unable to shower."
