43.0357,-76.0979,,,Feedback to the City,"416 Brookford Rd Syracuse, New York, 13224",Please use this space to provide feedback to the City,"This morning, our garbage was not picked up. The reason cited after talking to the Department of Public Works was that it was too heavy or exceeded the allowed weight. My wife watched the workers touching our trash can and leaving it there. We were attentive because this happened before. No one weighted the trash can or tried to use the new equipment at any time. I was told that this was a violation and that the garbage would not be picked up until next week. They set up a bulk garbage pick up for next week and will have to keep garbage for one week in my garage. This will also use one of two allowed bulk pickups for the year. I put the trash out myself and it was not very heavy and the lid was closed. How can one say the our garbage exceed the weight without weighing it? Also, after the worker checked our trash can or bin, they left the lid off which resulted on having lot of snow in it which will make it even heavier. I have lived in the city for 25 years and this type of situation never occurred until now.  A few months ago, the same thing happened and they picked up the garbage the following day. When the workers did pick up the garbage the next day they did it yelling obscenities for several minutes (my wife and daughter were home and witnessed that). I did not reported this because I thought it was rare event.  This now happens for the second time without telling or cursing but the same type of dismissive behavior.  This needs to be looking into and I expect someone to contact me.  When I called this morning and asked to speak to a supervisor, they asked for my contact information but I’m still waiting to hear from that person.  We pay an obscene amount of taxes for me to be wasting my time dealing with this issue.  I already spent almost 2 hours of my time at work dealing with this.

43.0496,-76.1478,,,Feedback to the City,"333 E Washington St Syracuse, NY, 13202, USA",Please use this space to provide feedback to the City,The fact that you don’t even have an option to select for street safety during snow is attesting that this city is playing games with the lives of Syracuse residents and temp residents/ visitors. There is no plow during extreme weather and the roads are not salted neither before or during or after. 8-9am is standard for working hours. I shouldn’t have to sleep in the parking lot of my job so that I don’t die on the road due to this cities neglect of its roads. Myself and other concerned residents are going to petitions to the state at a federal and local level to investigate what you all have going on in Syracuse during winter seasons. You are not proactive about the street and neglect almost all of the north side and other areas regularly. You should be ashamed.
